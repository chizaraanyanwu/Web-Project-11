  <!-- A little information on the beginning of my journey -->
  <details>
    <summary>Some background information</summary>
    <p>In Februrary of 2020, much like other people,
    I was bored out of my mind. My best friend, Heidi was Chinese and her English wasn't very good. 
    I wanted to learn Chinese to better her life.

    <p>So I did what anyone would do, I went to Duolingo</p>
    <p>I finished the course, but I wanted more. I wanted to be fluent in Chinese and to talk 
    like a native speaker. I tried out a bunch more sites and podcasts and even quit in
    2021 but I went back to it.

  <h2>Different Study Techniques I've used</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Duolingo</dt>
    <dd>It was nice, but it didn't go indepth.<del>Too gamified</del></dd> <!--Strikethrough-->
    <dt>Rosetta Stone</dt>
    <dd>All the fun stuff was behind a paywall, UI was too complicated</dd>
    <dt>HelloChinese</dt>
    <dd>Very good. Examples with native speakers, writing, speaking, listening. Big paywall though.</dd>
    <dt>Skritter</dt>
    <dd>Using it now. Very good for vocabulary which I'm bad at.</dd>

  <!-- Info on history of Chinese -->
  <section>
    <h2>Some background information on Chinese</h2>
    <p>An ancient form of Chinese, Jia-gu Wen was found on bones dated back to 1500 BC.
    It also has many dialects with Mandarin being one of them. The word for chinese comes from sanskrit, 
    another east asian language. 
    Most Chinese people only know about 2,500 characters from the over 10,000 that exist!
